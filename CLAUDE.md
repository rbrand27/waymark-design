# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**waymark-design** is a design-focused repository for Waymark. It is in early/initial setup — no build system, dependencies, or framework have been configured yet.

## Repository Structure

```
waymark-design/
├── README.md        # Placeholder (contains "Test")
├── template.html    # Empty HTML template
└── CLAUDE.md        # This file
```

## Current State

- No package.json or dependency management
- No build tooling, linting, or formatting configuration
- No test framework or tests
- No established tech stack or architecture patterns

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project takes shape — add build commands, architecture decisions, and conventions as they are established.
